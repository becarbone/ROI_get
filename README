This macro is used to get ROI from .tiff images. It was designed for co-culture
but this generally just means that the image should be:

1024x1024
4 channels
Cyan, Blue, Green, Red
not RGB
not z-stack

But you can change the # of channels and the colors of the channels.

It has you pick the file to save the ROI in - creates nested channel folders and saves
each of the channels separately. It also has you pick a file to save the ROIManager info
in - this allows you to see where on the image the ROI was selected when opened in imagej.

You can choose a polygon ROI selector or a rectangular one.

For each image, it will ask you if there in an ROI in the image, then to pick a name - 
this is for the individual ROI. I will usually just add a "...-1" etc... to the iamge name. 
If you type anything other than "yes" it will close the image and move you to the next one. 
If you see an ROI, type "yes", it will load your selector and zoom in on the image.

When you have selected the ROI and hit "ok" it will automatically save the ROI as individual
channels in each of the aforementioned folders with the name you specified and "_color".
It will print the name of the ROI and the are of the selection as well, I'd recommend
manually copying it to a spreadsheet in case you accidentally close an image/want to restart
for any reason. If you restart the program it will not retain the previously listed areas.

At the end of the program, it automatically saves the areas, but it only saves
the areas collected during the specific run of the program. This means if you close it/restart
it at any point it will save the areas from the point at which you restarted it.

This macro is currently used for all co-culture analysis.
